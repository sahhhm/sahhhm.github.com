<p>I have always wanted to keep track of my readings along with a small summary/few thoughts.</p>
<p>ps, no spellcheck </p>

<h1> 2014 </h1>

<b> Blindness <br/> Jose Saramago - Trs. Giovanni Pontiero | Kindle/Print | 5/5</b>
<blockquote> The only book to make me rush to the library and checkout a
  print copy, due to an expired kindle loan, so that I could finish
  and get the closure I so desired, Blindness is a magnificent work and
  an excellent commentary on the world we live in and the world we
  could be living in! I read this during the Ebola media mega-hype (I
  know it's still a very valid issue around the world) and while
  season five of The Walking Dead was airing, but the takeaways and impact of the
  novel are not tied to any specific cultural or social issue. The
  plot of the story intrigues: A man stopped at a red light all of a
  sudden becomes blind. Soon after more and more folks become blind as
  well, leading the government to intervene, trying to quarantine the
  diseased until a cure is found. The story advances while
  continuously providing an intriguing dialogue on the morals and
  actions of humanity and an overarching desire to want and try to
  survive. Certain characters will make you cheer, while other will
  make you curse on the train. Additionally, Saramago weaves a unique
  style throughout the novel by not using direct names (example: "The
  first blind man") and not relying on conventional dialogue to convey
  the communications between the characters. I cannot convey how truly
  beautifully the book reads -- Saramago's style is incredibly cool
  and just awesome. A true gem.

<b> Interpreter of Maladies <br/> Jhumpa Lahiri | Kindle | 5/5</b>
<blockquote> Interpreter of Maladies is a beautiful collection of
  short stories with a characterset of primarily Indians, Indians
  having immigrated or been born in America, as well as "Americanized"
  Indians visiting India. The stories aren't effective simply because
  of the fact Lahiri's characters are Indian, but rather because of
  the style and impactful writing Lahiri is able to convey through her
  writing. While briskly making my way through the stories, I often
  found myself relating to many of the scenarios, juxtaposing some of
  the character disconnects against those of my own parents (and
  against many other first generation American's that I know). Suffice
  to say, you don't have to be Indian, an immigrant, or anything
  special to get something out of Lahiri's work; you simply need to
  have an excitement for the diverse world we live in!
</blockquote>

<b> Shantaram <br/> Gregory David Roberts | Print | 4/5</b>
<blockquote>Shantaram a autobiographical adventure based on the author's life. A
  young Australian man escapes from prison, arrives in Bombay, and falls in love
  with the country of India. Not the standard "adventure novel" I'd
  been familiar with, but hey, who cares! Throughout the novel we see
  Linbaba living the slum life, becoming a presence in the crime world, and joining the
  retinue of India's mafia. Never short on adventure, the novel is a
  bit wordy at times and I felt like the book ran a bit too long. With
  that said, there's certainly still a lot of substance and intrigue
  making the push for the finish worthwhile!
</blockquote>

<b> McSorley's Wonderful Saloon/Old Mr. Flood (via Up In the Old Hotel) <br/> Joseph Mitchell | Print | 5/5</b>
<blockquote>A man who instantly converted me to a "The New Yorker" faithful,
Mitchel's writing is ICONIC. Often profiling folks or settings in or relating
to New York City, Mitchell is someone that everyone with even the slightest
connection to the city (or, at a more general level, humanity) should read.
This is not your modern day NYC circlejerk. This is some of the most beautiful
writing, conveying some of the most beautiful characterizations I've ever
encountered. Reading through these stories (most of which are factual), you'll
be invited to a rare and intimate glimpse of the not so distant past.
</blockquote>


<b> A Wise Man's Fear : The Kingkiller Chronicle: Day Two <br/> Patrick Rothfuss | Kindle | 5/5</b>
<blockquote>This book was definitely a bit larger than the first, and 
it felt it; however, this second installment changed up the status 
quo literally halfway through, involving a new set of characters, new
settings, and new adventures! Definitely a welcome expansion on everything
that had been introduced prior (you can only go to a music hall/chase a
girl in the same setting so many times)! The biggest excitement that this book 
left me was with how this entire series is going to end in the final 
installment (not yet published). Rothfuss has confirmed that the third book 
will be the final book in the Kvothe saga (not sure if there'll be another 
central figure continuing the story... but fingers crossed)! A bit of advice: 
wait a year or so before starting this series -- you may be finding yourself
with a bit of regret having to wait for the final installment to be released!
</blockquote>

<b> Housekeeping <br/> Marilynne Robinson | Kindle | 5/5</b>
<blockquote>An absolute delight. I would have hated reading this book
for school (I know there is A LOT that went over my head), but wow,
Robinson can write. A vocabulary vastly stronger than a well-prepared
standardized test taker, Robinson is able to involve the reader with the
upbringing of two children and their various caretakers in a way that
keeps the reader coming back for more. The book is not an "edge of your 
seat thriller" by any means, but the insane level of writing will
absolutely have you coming back for more. With this single work, 
Marilynne Robinson has immediately jumped to the top of my list of 
favorite authors -- cannot wait to pour through her other works.</blockquote>

<b> The Name of the Wind : The Kingkiller Chronicle: Day One <br/> Patrick Rothfuss | Book | 5/5</b>
<blockquote>Wanting to get lost in a fantasy world (a genre I'm typically
not fond of), I gave Rothfuss' offering a try. I must say, there was not a 
single thing that could draw me away from this one (not even work!). Very entertaining 
and intriguing, Rothfuss has developed an relatable world of magic. Not being a 
regular to the realm of fantasy works, I felt completely at ease plowing through
this book. The characterset is manageable (looking at you, ASOIAF!) and diverse.
Some critique the main character as having "everything come too easy/naturally"
for him throughout the series. To that, I say, so what!!! It makes the entire 
series that much more enjoyable (especially when you take into account the state that
he's in when he's recounting his story...). If you're looking to immerse yourself, 
look no further!</blockquote>

<b> Ender's Game <br/> Orson Scott Card | Print | 4/5</b>
<blockquote>A story told primarily through children, I think 
I would have had a deeper connection reading this book as a 
child. As an "adult", I still found the book thought provoking
and relevant in the techological world we live in. Additionally,
if you're interested in the divide between "the value of art" and 
"the beliefs of an artist" I suggest searching for Orson Scott Card.
(My opinion would to be to read through the book first, but that's
just me. If you're super sensitive to supporting someone
whose opinions/support differ strongly from you, check it out 
from a library... or just read about him first. See this whole
divide is super tricky -- Good Luck!) </blockquote>


<b> The Master and Margarita <br/> Mikhail Bulgakov | Print | 5/5</b>
<blockquote>A book of major significance in the Soviet era, I
  wholehartedly know there is much of this book that I either don't
  understand, or that went over my head. I will state, however, that
  the translators of this edition (Burgin and O'Connor) did a great
  service with many of their notes explaining certain ambiguities in
  the translation or certain references that would be lost by a
  modern English reader. With that said, the novel holds on its own
  merit as a powerful work which blatantly weaves the stories of
  Faust and Pontius Pilate throughout. Additionlly, some of the
  commentary/satire on the Soviet era can stil be picked up by readers
  who either don't have the historical background or who didn't live
  in the Soviet Bloc! As an added motivation for reading, the
  uncensored novel was originally passed around however possible
  ("Samizdat" -- there's a bit of interesting reading to do on that
  subject as well!) with a great risk of punishment for being
  caught. Sort of provides an interesting perspective to the modern
  debate of censorship that's been in the news recently (or maybe not,
  but it's still a great book regardless)! </blockquote>

<b> Thinking, Fast and Slow <br/> Daniel Kahneman | Kindle | Currently Reading</b>
<blockquote></blockquote>


<b> A Journal of the Plague Year <br/> Daniel Defoe | Kindle | 4/5</b>
<blockquote>I gave <i>Journal of the Plague Year</i> a read after
  hearing Garcia Marquez considered this novel among his favorites for the journalistic
  writing that "reads as fantasy". Recounting the events (fictionally,
  though there are many comparisons to actual accounts) of the Great
  Plague of 1665, Defoe's work still maintains a relevancy for
  "modern" readers and at a personal level provides me with a rare
  glimpse of Marquez' background/inspiration.  </blockquote>


<b> The Magus <br/> John Fowles | Kindle | 5/5</b>
<blockquote>The novel is categorized as "postmodern", and while I have no idea what that means, as I started reading and getting
involved with the book, I found myself thinking "yeah, this book <i>is</i> postmodern, hmph!" While I'm sure a survey of literary 
movements is long overduem, this is quite a difficult book to explain to people. It's a book that will keep you curious, engaged,
and confused throughout but is not like any book I've read before. Littered with mytholgoy and symbols (some of which are
well-explained) the novel certainly isn't a carefree mystery to be read over fruity drinks on the beach; however, the complexity
and layers within the book will surely have you thinking about the extremes of truth and lies.</blockquote>


<b> Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking <br/> Susan Cain | Kindle | 5/5</b>
<blockquote>Finally! A book I can authoritatively point to in defense of my introverted tendencies. As we all know, "with
great power comes great responsibility", and I feel that advice needs heeding after reading this book. In particular, I think it's
easy to now justify certain tendencies because "it's in the book, and it's ok!"; however, after my initial rationalization of the novel 
dies down, I think it becomes more important to not use this book as a defense mechanism or a "tell-all" book, but rather as a guiding 
point in being more self-aware as well as being more cognizant of others. This isn't a how-to or an introverts versus extroverts book,
but rather an indepth look at introverts and the world in which they live and participate in. Juxtaposing introverts and extroverts
in similar situations throughout the novel yields the advice that the entire introvert-extrovert spectrum exists in all facets of
our life, and by being aware of such truths, we should be able to harness such knowledge to become more successful in the various
relationships we maintain (personal, work, etc). A high suggestion for everyone to read.</blockquote>


<b>The Road <br/> Cormac McCarthy | Kindle | 5/5</b>
<blockquote>A gray novel following a father and his son in a futuristic world. McCarthy captures your attention through a fairly linear
novel with a pointed diction, maintaining interest in such a bleak world, allowing the reader to empathize with the father and son's 
hope. Certainly not action packed in the conventional sense, The Road sends its punches through beautiful and capturing writing.</blockquote>


<b>A Feast for Crows: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Four <br/> George R. R. Martin | Kindle | 3/5</b>
<blockquote>Better than Super Bowl 2014, but noticeably worse than the other three installments, A Feast for Crows dragged more than a
bit too long. The drama of two "parallel" novels has been well-disclosed and discussed, and though GRRM clearly
believes he did what's best, I definitely felt a lot of pain wading through this encyclopedia. With that said, there definitely
was SOME plot advancement, along with what I hope is a beautiful foundation for the sixth and seventh books... not that I'd stop reading
if Martin rambles for the final three novels anyway!</blockquote>

<b>Let the Great World Spin<br/> Colum McCann | Kindle | 4/5</b>
<blockquote>A highly poetic book (fiction) set in grungy New York in the 70's, the book alternates through a diverse, engaging, and related set of 
characters while weaving Philippe Petit's breathtaking tightrope walk through the backdrop of each character's story. While the 
alternating character's perspective per chapter began to take its toll on me by the end of the book, McCann has definitely mastered
the English language and is able to keep you reading through unparalled prose. A highly suggested read for anyone spending any amount of time
in New York City.</blockquote>

<b>A Storm of Swords: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Three <br/> George R. R. Martin | Kindle | 5/5</b>
<blockquote>Building on the epic beauty of the first two installments, the third sealed the deal. Maritn is a force
to be reckoned with. Filled with twists and turns that make you doubt your prior allegiances, the books' colossal size reads
like a novella the night before your 10-page essay is due!</blockquote>

<h1> 2013 </h1>
<b>The Unbearable Lightness of Being<br/> Milan Kundera | Print | Unfinished</b>
<blockquote></blockquote>

<b>A Clash of Kings: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Two <br/> George R. R. Martin | Kindle | 5/5</b>
<blockquote>Would that I could express how expansive and captivting Martin's epic is. Filled with a 
remarkable cast of characters, you often don't know who to and who not to be rooting for! Anyone 
whose been unfortunate enough to have spent time with me through my reading of the first and now
second novel in the series knows that I'm beyond addicted and am doing everything to continue my fix.
Within the second novel, a lot more of the "fantasy" elements became more apparent, but not in a manner
that repulsed me from the text. The only gripe is that with such a widespread cast of characters, you may 
be struggling to recall where certain characters storylines last ended: a challenge well worth the thought!</blockquote>

<b>A Game of Thrones: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book One<br/> George R. R. Martin | Kindle | 5/5</b>
<blockquote>I devoured this book. Checking it out from the Brooklyn Public Library on a whim, knowing nothing 
about the series, I was so immersed in Martin's fantasy world that less than halfway through I ordered a House of Stark
hoodie (ok, it was discounted for black friday, but still!) The introductory novel is so well-paced, imaginative, and 
shocking that I found myself finding any and every excuse to continue reading. The first of a planned seven book epic,
be warned that this novel contains many characters and many many pages of content... but so far, I've found the
time investment to be well worth effort (and perhaps social isolation ;)</blockquote>

<b>Wool Omnibus Edition (Wool 1 - 5)<br/> Hugh Howey | Kindle | 4/5</b>
<blockquote>Usually a stranger to science fiction, I gave Wool 1 a spin given its independent cult following coupled 
with its price point of free! I was amazed and found it incredibly challenging to put the book down. I
remember limiting my alcohol one night just so I could consciously finish the story on the train ride home! After the initial
offering, I decided to throw my money at Howey and purchased the first "third" of his saga. Anything written after part 1 was
due to the initial success and as an excited reader, I could tell. That's not to say that parts 2-5 weren't good, just that they
were different and written with a larger story in mind. In all, this is a spectacular work published independently through
Amazon and a stunning sci-fi tale in a post-apocalyptic world!</blockquote>

<b>The Tin Drum<br/> Gunter Grass - Trs, Breon Mitchell | Print | 4/5</b>
<blockquote>A thoroughly complex and at times questionable book, Gunter Grass really took me on a ride with The Tin Drum. Never really certain of young Oskar's 
actual state of being, Grass tells his story set in the Free City of Danzig utilizing a veiled narration perhaps mimicking 
the tumultuous years (twenties through early fifties) spanned by the novel. The veiled narration, which turned in a huge positive for the book by the end
was certainly a struggle through the early parts of the book...and it almost go the best of me. Fortunately, I stuck it out and enjoyed a relevant 
voice educating about the Free City of Danzig. I definitely recommend The Tin Drum, but know what you're in for before heavily investing!</blockquote>

<b>Seven American Deaths and Disasters<br/> Kenneth Goldsmith | Print | 4/5</b>
<blockquote>A collection of transcriptions covering Seven American Deaths and Disasters (starting with the death of John F. Kennedy), Goldsmith
is able to extract moments of complete shock, disbelief, and confusion and so plainly convey them through the written word. As someone who wasn't alive
during most of these moments (or too young to really understand the depth of what was unfolding), the eye-opening perspectives offered through these  
transcriptions are perspectives not easily conveyed through more conventional sources. As an added NYC bonus, the structure of the book makes it easy 
to pick up and read in quick intervals!</blockquote>

<b>100 Years of Solitude <br/> Gabriel Garcia Marquez | Print | 6/5</b>
<blockquote>Magical. Masterpiece. Originally claiming it my favorite book after reading it in 2006, One Hundred Years of Solitude's reign as 
the unquestionable best book in the universe remains. Stunning in depth, remarkable in story, Marquez immerses the reader with the Buendia family and 
the town of Macondo with a clinic of writing. This is a book worthy of infinite re-reads and I'll leave it at that. READ IT NOW.</blockquote>

<b>A Visit from the Goon Squad <br/> Jennifer Egan | Print | 4/5</b>
<blockquote>A very intriguing modern work, the book contains 13 chapters/stories that jump forward and backward yielding a non-linear, pieced story. 
The upside with this mode of storytelling is that you're spellbound to keep on reading and wanting more, while the downside is that you never really
get the satisfaction often found when completing a book. With a plot circling around the music industry on both the East and West coasts, Egan's
novel is definitely worth checking out if you're willing to try something different!</blockquote>

<b>Anthony Adverse, Vol. 3 <br/> Hervey Allen | Kindle | 5/5</b>
<blockquote>Perfection. The second half of this volume, chronicling early 1800s America is absolutely stunning. I will definitely be checking out Allen's
unfinished saga on colonial America <i>City in the Dawn</i> with extreme Haste. What a wonderful and satisfying end to a magificent work of art.</blockquote>

<b>Sugar, Salt, Fat: How the Food Giants Hooked Us <br/> Michael Moss | Kindle | 5/5</b>
<blockquote>Given the constant discussion of modern American health, Moss' insight in the world of processed foods helps unveil the curtain dropped 
over the past 50+ years by the titans of food. A book that doesn't tell you what you should and shouldn't eat, Moss tracks the three titled pillars 
of processed food providing knowledge on topics like the science behind the food, the industries attempt to limit/increase use of such ingredients, 
the role the government has played in attacking and defending the industries use of alarming ingredients, and so much more. Enveloping yourself in 
this book provides a perspective perhaps once unkonwn which will probably force you to at the least, rethink your eating and shopping habits.</blockquote>

<b>Anthony Adverse, Vol. 2 <br/> Hervey Allen | Kindle | 5/5</b>
<blockquote>While winded, this epic continues to please with poetic prose and a captivating plot. I'm getting the feeling that Allen didn't have an editor, but
at this point, I really don't care. The bulk of this volume dealth with the slave trade around the late 1700s and while I don't have the savvy to 
validate the truthfulness in all the accounts (this is fiction after all), the prose just reads as if you were there engrossed in the worlds 
Allen conquers. I still want more and more and more, yet cannot wait to see how this all comes together and ends in Volume 3! Bravo! </blockquote>

<b>Anthony Adverse, Vol. 1 <br/> Hervey Allen | Kindle | 5/5</b>
<blockquote>Reading the first few pages, the air of a masterpiece immediately emanates. An authorative literary force, Allen seems to beautifully capture
and convey through intricate detail the adventures rampant in the 1700s. Recommended to me by a high school history/philosophy teacher many (6) years ago,
I can't believe that I'm just now waddling through this work. With a certainty that I will not be dissappointed, I cannot wait to see what else Allen has in store!</blockquote>

<b>War Brides <br/> Helen Bryan | Kindle | 0/5</b>
<blockquote>Absolutely the worst. I'm not even sure what the point of the book was. The plot was looser than my polenta and the epilogue was a tour 
of confusion.</blockquote>

<b>Lamb <br/> Christopher Moore | Kindle | 4/5</b>
<blockquote>This is a book that will absolutely grab my attention more than once. As I randomly picked the book up, I wasn't quite sure what to expect;
however, as a super high level abstraction, this satirical, yet extremely well-researched novel chronicles the first 30 years of 
Jesus' life and his attempts to learn how to be the messiah.
Having a less than minimal understanding of the Bible, I was able to impess some of my more religous-concious friends with 
surprisingly accurate (though let me repeat, satirical) anecdotes from this book. So with all that said, even though it's not required, any kind of religious
background will help and enrich your laughter. And if you aren't well-versed with Christianity, let this be a light-hearted immersion into a 
highly controversial topic! </blockquote>

<b>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes <br/>Arthur Concan Doyle | Kindle | 4/5</b>
<blockquote>Such quick and delightful stories -- perfect for reading on a train ride! I found all of the stories to be engaging, unique, and in fact
quite mysterious. Though I'm not sure these are mysteries that can be solved by a simple readthrough, due to the narrative
in which the stories are told; however, this does not reduce any of the adventure in reading through each story! I'm not sure I'd recommend this to 
everyone, but for heavy readers or anyone really, who wants to try something different this would be a good start!</blockquote>


<b>Brain Rules <br/>John Medina | Kindle | 5/5</b>
<blockquote>The chapter on stress needs to be read by EVERYONE. PERIOD. This is quite a fantastic book for multiple reasons: it's scientific, well-researched (or so it appears), and pragmatic. This isn't a "raise your IQ" type of book, far from it. Instead, the author explains 12 "rules" about how the brain works, and develops an interesting story about the specific rule. While generally reserved for the end of each chapter, the author does an, in my opinion, great job of leaving personal opinion out of the discussion (but does include anecdotes to strengthen his point). But yes, this is a magical book well executed in all regards and a benefit for anyone with a brain (hint: you). </blockquote>


<b>In Evil Hour <br/>Gabriel Garcia Marquez | Print | 5/5</b>
<blockquote>Almond Trees. But seriously, this isn't one of GGM's best writings, but it is indeed a splendid, magical joy to read. A relatively short book, it recursively emits prose so beautiful that you want to re-re-read just to make sure you're really getting all out of the writing that you can!</blockquote>

<b>Water for Elephants <br/>Sara Gruen | Kindle | 4/5</b>
<blockquote>What a surprising book! A historical fiction piece covering a traveling American circus in the 1930s. While my expectations
were originally tempered, I quickly found myself rolling through page after page. Definitely couldn't put this one down even though I felt it was a bit
over the top (in regards to the love narrative) at times. I strongly suggest this book to anyone with even the slightest interest in an American
history -- I would imagine a perspective this well-researched and engaging will be hard to come by otherwise.</blockquote>

<b>The Color Purple <br/>Alice Walker | Kindle | 4/5</b>
<blockquote>A moving story of the south covering deep thoughts about Love, God, and other things. Certainly not a quick 
pick-me up, but definitely worth the investment the book requires.</blockquote>

<h1> 2012 </h1>

<b>Les Miserables <br/>Victor Hugo - Trs, Norman Denny | Kindle | 5/5</b>
<blockquote>Without a doubt one of the best books I've ever read. The book carries a beautiful weight behind it, with
 Hugo refusing to leave a detail behind. Love, revolution, faith, history, and pretty much everything else is covered in this 
 epic set in France. The density does sometimes feel like the book is a chore (it's not!), but power through as everything is written with
 such purity that when it's all said and done, you want even more detail. And while the musicals/plays/etc. have created a beautiful 
 story from this monster, the book for exceeds in storytelling and plot alike... don't shy away from this one!</blockquote>

<b>The Great Gatsby <br/>F. Scott Fitzgerald | Print | 2/5</b> 
<blockquote>Reread this one in anticipation of the new film being released in 2013. To be honest, I'm not sure what all the hype regarding
was in high school. The "love" story of this book (which I am assuming was the appeal in high school) is interesting, but ultimately just OK. 
I would say that the perspective of the 1920s was quite refreshing.</blockquote>
 
<b>Importance of Being Earnest <br/> Oscar Wilde | Kindle | 5/5</b>
<blockquote>After reading Dorian Gray, I had a heightened interest in Wilde. Did a little research and realized he was known for his plays 
back in the day. As such, I read this charming play, one of the more spoken about. What a gem! A quick, readable, RELEVANT, and hilarious
play has not lost a step in over 100 years. Honestly, I thought that laughing out loud to a play written in the 1800s would be impossible...
but fortunately, I was wrong!</blockquote>

<b>The Picture of Dorian Gray <br/>Oscar Wilde | Kindle | 4/5</b>
<blockquote>Realizing this was free, in the open domain, I jumped at the opportunity to reread this work. The words and thoughts regarding
art were, as expected, beautiful and motivating. At times, however, I felt was just full of it and had no problem writing it out. Regardless,
this was, as mentioned, a beautiful account of Victorian life.</blockquote>

<b>Othello <br/>William Shakespeare | Kindle | 5/5</b>
<blockquote>Freakin' IAGO.... the hell, man!</blockquote>

<b>Twelfth Night <br/>William Shakespeare | Kindle | 4/5</b>
<blockquote>Never have I ever been inspired by Amanda Bynes to read a Shakespeare play...NOT. This was a nice way to dip feet into the 
world of Shakespeare. A cool plot that is eased into by watching <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/She%27s_The_Man">She's the Man</a>
first if you're a tad afraid of the big S. </blockquote>

<b>Fight Club <br/>Chuck Palahniuk | Kindle | 4/5</b>
<blockquote>Was gifted this one by a friend and having never seen the infamously talked-about film, I decided to give it a shot with no
knowledge of the plot at all. Quite a fast-paced and exciting read! The book was without question satisfying and thrilling but what sealed
the deal for me was coming to the conclusion of the "twist" right about the same time that the author properly revealed it in the story. 
Obviously worth reading if you're into the movie! </blockquote>

<b>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy <br/>Douglas Adams | Kindle | 5/5</b>
<blockquote>The first in the series, and without doubt the best. From A to B from B to C and now from A to C... or some dialogue about that.
Ridiculously funny and truthfully, no sci-fi nerdiness required (though it probably doesn't hurt). I'd read this just to have a reference or 
two to impress a nerd fixing a computer problem. Ha, just kidding, it really isn't a super nerdy book, though you'll finally find the 
source of every other computer science major responding with the number 42 when faced with a difficult problem.</blockquote>

<b>The Restaurant at the End of the Universe <br/>Douglas Adams | Kindle | 4/5</b>
<blockquote>The second in the series. Not as funny as the first, but still quite entertaining and witty. </blockquote>

<b>Life, the Universe and Everything <br/>Douglas Adams | Kindle | 4/5</b>
<blockquote>The third in the series. On par with the third. Every so often, I stopped and just wondered where Adams came up with some
of his stuff. Also, the reprise of Slartibartfast from the original brought a smile to my face!</blockquote>

<b>So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish <br/>Douglas Adams | Kindle | 2/5</b>
<blockquote>My least favorite was the fourth of this series. This one seemed to take a turn for the worse with a heavy love arc. To each his 
own... but at least, yay Dolphins!</blockquote>

<b>Mostly Harmless <br/>Douglas Adams | Kindle | 3/5</b>
<blockquote>The fifth book in the series, and finally so. I think reading all of these back may have hurt the series, but talking with some other
friends who've read them, it seems to be agreed upon that the series slowly slopes downwards from the phenomenal first. This installment does 
however bring some closure to the series and left me with a good taste of Adams "trilogy".</blockquote>

<b>The Hunger Games <br/>Suzanne Collins | Kindle | 1/5</b>
<blockquote>I dunno... I mean, the plot was interesting enough, though more predictable than I would have liked. Ultimately, the red flags
set off by naming a baker's son Peeta led me to finish this one quicker rather than slower. Again, the plot was semi interesting, but in the 
end there wasn't nearly enough to intrigue me to read the final two in the series.</blockquote>

<b>Middlesex <br/>Jeffrey Eugenides | Print | 5/5</b>
<blockquote>Calliope Stephanides is such a vibrant and exciting protagonist discussing a not-so-often talked about topic of intersex and 
more broadly gender identity. Hey, after taking a Sociology of Gender class in college, you can't help but be drawn to these novels. And
rightfully so, having won the Pulitzer Prize Middlesex is a semi-historic and excitable tour de force drawing on events through several 
decades.</blockquote>
 
<b>The Green House <br/>Mario Vargas Llosa | Print | 4/5</b>
<blockquote>While my heart probably would give this 5/5, my brain currently sits at a 4/5. What a work by Garcia Marquez' arch-nemesis!
The difficulty in this novel comes in multiple storylines arching through varying time frames. Regardless, the imagery and beauty
in which this story is present makes it a no brainer for anyone with a pre-existing (or highly patient) pallet for Spanish authors. 
Also, after reading through The Green House you'll definitely want to enjoy a handle or two of pisco!</blockquote>

<p>I have always wanted to keep track of my readings along with a few reactions -- nothing scholarly nor authoritative... so here goes nothing.</p>
<p>Listed in order read (newest first) except for series read back-to-back for which I catalogue sequentially.
Also, no spell check has been emplored. Sorry</p>

<h1> 2013 </h1>

<b>Water for Elephants | Sara Gruen | Kindle | Currently Reading</b>
<blockquote></blockquote>

<b>The Intelligent Investor | Benjamin Graham | Print | Currently Reading</b>
<blockquote></blockquote>

<b>The Color Purple | Alice Walker | Kindle | 4/5</b>
<blockquote>A moving story of the south covering deep thoughts about Love, God, and other things. Definitely not a quick 
pick-me up, but definitely worth the investment the book requires.</blockquote>

<h1> 2012 </h1>

<b>Les Miserables | Victor Hugo - Trs, Norman Denny | Kindle | 5/5</b>
<blockquote>Without a doubt one of the best books I've ever read. The book carries a beautiful weight behind it, with
 Hugo refusing to leave a detail behind. Love, revolution, faith, history, and pretty much everything else is covered in this 
 epic set in France. The density does sometimes feel like the book is a chore (it's not!), but power through as everything is written with
 such purity that when it's all said and done, you want even more detail. And while the musicals/plays/etc. have created a beautiful 
 story from this monster, the book for exceeds in storytelling and plot alike... don't shy away from this one!</blockquote>

<b>The Great Gatsby | F. Scott Fitzgerald | Print | 3/5</b> 
<blockquote>Reread this one in anticipation of the new film being released in 2013. To be honest, I'm not sure what all the hype regarding
was in high school. The "love" story of this book (which I am assuming was the appeal in high school) is interesting, but ultimately just OK. 
I would say that the perspective of the 1920s was quite refreshing.</blockquote>
 
<b>Importance of Being Earnest | Oscar Wilde | Kindle | 5/5</b>
<blockquote>After reading Dorian Gray, I had a heightened interest in Wilde. Did a little research and realized he was known for his plays 
back in the day. As such, I read this charming play, one of the more spoken about. What a gem! A quick, readable, RELEVANT, and hilarious
play has not lost a step in over 100 years. Honestly, I thought that laughing out loud to a play written in the 1800s would be impossible...
but fortunately, I was wrong!</blockquote>

<b>The Picture of Dorian Gray | Oscar Wilde | Kindle | 4/5</b>
<blockquote>Realizing this was free, in the open domain, I jumped at the opportunity to reread this work. The words and thoughts regarding
art were, as expected, beautiful and motivating. At times, however, I felt was just full of it and had no problem writing it out. Regardless,
this was, as mentioned, a beautiful account of Victorian life.</blockquote>

<b>Othello | William Shakespeare | Kindle | 5/5</b>
<blockquote>Freakin' IAGO.... the hell, man!</blockquote>

<b>Twelfth Night | William Shakespeare | Kindle | 4/5</b>
<blockquote>Never have I ever been inspired by Amanda Bynes to read a Shakespeare play...NOT. This was a nice way to dip feet into the 
world of Shakespeare. A cool plot that is eased into by watching <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/She%27s_The_Man">She's the Man</a>
first if you're a tad afraid of the big S. </blockquote>

<b>Fight Club | Chuck Palahniuk | Kindle | 4/5</b>
<blockquote>Was gifted this one by a friend and having never seen the infamously talked-about film, I decided to give it a shot with no
knowledge of the plot at all. Quite a fast-paced and exciting read! The book was without question satisfying and thrilling but what sealed
the deal for me was coming to the conclusion of the "twist" right about the same time that the author properly revealed it in the story. 
Obviously worth reading if you're into the movie! </blockquote>

<b>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy | Douglas Adams | Kindle | 5/5</b>
<blockquote>The first in the series, and without doubt the best. From A to B from B to C and now from A to C... or some dialogue about that.
Ridiculously funny and truthfully, no sci-fi nerdiness required (though it probably doesn't hurt). I'd read this just to have a reference or 
two to impress a nerd fixing a computer problem. Ha, just kidding, it really isn't a super nerdy book, though you'll finally find the 
source of every other computer science major responding with the number 42 when faced with a difficult problem.</blockquote>

<b>The Restaurant at the End of the Universe | Douglas Adams | Kindle | 4/5</b>
<blockquote>The second in the series. Not as funny as the first, but still quite entertaining and witty. </blockquote>

<b>Life, the Universe and Everything | Douglas Adams | Kindle | 4/5</b>
<blockquote>The third in the series. On par with the third. Every so often, I stopped and just wondered where Adams came up with some
of his stuff. Also, the reprise of Slartibartfast from the original brought a smile to my face!</blockquote>

<b>So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish | Douglas Adams | Kindle | 2/5</b>
<blockquote>My least favorite was the fourth of this series. This one seemed to take a turn for the worse with a heavy love arc. To each his 
own... but at least, yay Dolphins!</blockquote>

<b>Mostly Harmless | Douglas Adams | Kindle | 3/5</b>
<blockquote>The fifth book in the series, and finally so. I think reading all of these back may have hurt the series, but talking with some other
friends who've read them, it seems to be agreed upon that the series slowly slopes downwards from the phenomenal first. This installment does 
however bring some closure to the series and left me with a good taste of Adams "trilogy".</blockquote>

<b>The Hunger Games | Suzanne Collins | Kindle | 1/5</b>
<blockquote>I dunno... I mean, the plot was interesting enough, though more predictable than I would have liked. Ultimately, the red flags
set off by naming a baker's son Peeta led me to finish this one quicker rather than slower. Again, the plot was semi interesting, but in the 
end there wasn't nearly enough to intrigue me to read the final two in the series.</blockquote>

<b>Middlesex | Jeffrey Eugenides | Print | 5/5</b>
<blockquote>Calliope Stephanides is such a vibrant and exciting protagonist discussing a not-so-often talked about topic of intersex and 
more broadly gender identity. Hey, after taking a Sociology of Gender class in college, you can't help but be drawn to these novels. And
rightfully so, having won the Pulitzer Prize Middlesex is a semi-historic and excitable tour de force drawing on events through several 
decades.</blockquote>
 
<b>The Green House | Mario Vargas Llosa | Print | 4/5</b>
<blockquote>While my heart probably would give this 5/5, my brain currently sits at a 4/5. What a work by Garcia Marquez' arch-nemesis!
The difficulty in this novel comes in multiple storylines arching through varying time frames. Regardless, the imagery and beauty
in which this story is present makes it a no brainer for anyone with a pre-existing (or highly patient) pallet for Spanish authors. 
Also, after reading through The Green House you'll definitely want to enjoy a handle or two of pisco!</blockquote>
